        <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
            An interactive way to onboard new employees with current Aviture employees, benefits and culture.

            <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                New employees begin a scavenger hunt during their first 30 days of starting. The purpose is to drive engagement with Aviture. The new hires focus is to complete as many tasks as they can within the given time limit. 
            On the other side of the coin, Aviturians have a chance to meet and help acclimate new hires into Aviture’s ecosystem.>

            <p class="mb0 f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure i">Interactive</p>
            <p class="mt0 f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
            The idea of this scavenger hunt is to pair learning with hands on activities. To get new hires moving around the office, meeting new people, and understanding who Aviture is.
            </p> 
            <p>
            <p class="mb0 f5 pa1 f3-ns lh-copy measure i">Self Sustainable</p>
            <p class="mt0 f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
            This on-boarding system is flexible to match Aviture’s evolving culture and benefits. Tasks should be able to be added and removed when appropriate.
            </p>
            <p class="mb0 pb1 f5 pa1 f3-ns lh-copy measure i">Accessible</p>
            <p class="mt0 f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
            The Aviture first 30 should be easy to access from a new hires perspective. Completion of tasks should be the challenge, not the sign off.
            </p>
            <p class="mb0 f5 pa1 f3-ns lh-copy measure i">Fairness</p>  
            <p class="mt0 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
            All tasks must be available during the new hires first 30 days. Tasks that are seasonal will not be added. Tasks must fit Avitures current culture and will be curated to match over time.
